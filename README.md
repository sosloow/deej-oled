# deej OLED

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/sosloow/deej-oled/ci_checks.yml)

Custom deej firmware for RP2040 Pro Micro board by Tenstar Robot. Written in Rust, with use of Embassy framework.

This is a learning project with a lot of unnecessary bells and whistles. It uses an external MCP3008 ADC to read voltage from faders. It also connects with an SSD1322 OLED screen to play animations and stuff.
